# OxDEM
OxDEM is a software tool for Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations, designed for modeling granular and powder systems in engineering applications. This repository contains the source code, scripts, build configurations, and proprietary precompiled binary components for OxDEM.
Please note that this is an ongoing project. The repository will be updated periodically with new developments, improvements to the methodology, and additional features.

## License
This project is licensed under the MIT License with restrictions on proprietary binary components. See the LICENSE file for details. The open-source parts can be freely used, modified, and distributed, while the proprietary binaries in the lib/ directory (e.g., OxDEM_library.o) are for academic and research use only and cannot be reverse-engineered or redistributed without permission.

## Download and Installation
